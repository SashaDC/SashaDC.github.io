            This site is currently under going a redesign to better reflect the
            current me as the last time it was updated was in April. The new
            site will be available on the 20/12/2025 and feature more recent
            projects and activities I've been up to. I hope this doesn't leave a
            bad impression as I also have to balance other commitments like my
            work and family, other than that I hope you enjoy the site!

        <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there, My name is Sasha and I'm studying at Dev Academy to become a
          Fullstack developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I decided to attend Dev Academy as I've always I wanted to work in the
          Software developer industry since I was 14 due to my interest in tech
          and coding. I had previously tried to become a Fullstack developer in
          2024 by attending another course ran by Developers Institute but after
          a month of studying there the institute had to liquidate leaving me
          with no options but to work off my debt and wait. &#128517;
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Here's 3 things to get to know me:</h2>
        <ol class="center">
          <li>I'm a massive gamer and into all sorts of things. &#127918;</li>
          <li>
            I'm a quick learner and can focus in for hours to meet deadlines.
            &#128523;
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm a little shy and awkward at first but that will end very quickly
            if the conversation heads towards something I'm passionate about.
            &#128578;
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What is this website about</h2>
        <p>
          This website is to display my progress on the work I've done through
          the foundations portion of Dev Academy, and to help me reflect on my
          time during it.
