        <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there, My Name is Sasha and I'm studying at Dev Academy to become a
          Fullstack developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I decided to attend Dev Academy as I've always sort of known I wanted
          to work in the Software developer industry since I was 14 due to my
          interest in tech and coding. I had previously tried to become a
          Fullstack developer in 2024 by attending another course ran by
          Developers Institute but annoyingly after a month of studying there
          the institute had to liquidate leaving me with no options but to work
          off debt and wait. &#128517;
        </p>

        <h2>What is this blog about</h2>

          to help me become a better webdesigner
