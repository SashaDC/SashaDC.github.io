        <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there, My name is Sasha and I'm studying at Dev Academy to become a
          Fullstack developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I decided to attend Dev Academy as I've always sort of known I wanted
          to work in the Software developer industry since I was 14 due to my
          interest in tech and coding. I had previously tried to become a
          Fullstack developer in 2024 by attending another course ran by
          Developers Institute but annoyingly after a month of studying there
          the institute had to liquidate leaving me with no options but to work
          off debt and wait. &#128517;
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Here's 3 things to get to know me:</h2>
        <ol class="center">
          <li>
            I'm a massive gamer and play many different genres and not limited
            either PC or Consoles. &#127918;
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm somewhat of a procrastinator but I make up for it as I'm a quick
            learner and can focus in for hours on end to meet deadlines.
            &#128523;
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally lucky number 3, I'm a bit shy and awkward at first but that
            will end very quickly if someone talks to me about the stuff I'm
            passionate about. &#128578;
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h2>What is this blog about</h2>
        <p>
          This blog is to keep track of the projects I've made or working on and
          to help me become a better webdesigner.
        </p>
        <p>I'll probably fix and change aesthetics soon.</p>
