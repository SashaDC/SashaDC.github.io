# Original Portfolio Site (GitHub Pages)

My first portfolio website created during the foundations phase at Dev Academy Aotearoa.

## About This Site

This site was built as part of my learning journey at Dev Academy to showcase my reflections and assessments during the foundations course. It features basic HTML and CSS with a focus on clean, simple design and responsive layouts.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3** - Custom styling and responsive design
- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting

## Purpose

This site served as:
- A portfolio during my bootcamp foundations phase
- A collection of weekly reflections and technical blog posts
- Practice for fundamental web development skills
- Documentation of my learning journey
