        <h1>Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset.</h1>
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains don’t just stop growing
          after a certain age but are in fact malleable like plastic which
          allows us to learn, adapt, and grow the connections in our brain. By
          using repetitive actions and positive experiences we are able to learn
          new things much better as it reinforces those connections allowing us
          to recall and apply the things we’ve learnt.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The way I might personally engage with the principles of
          neuroplasticity is by coding everyday even if it's for a minimum of an
          hour or 2 a day as well as challenging myself with coding problems and
          sprint stretches as it will help build up my ‘brain connections’(or
          bridges) through repetitive motion.
        </p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <ul class="center">
          <p>Some ways to increase neuroplasticity is:</p>
          <li>Repetition</li>

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
          A Growth Mindset is the idea that a person's abilities or intelligence
          aren’t a predetermined thing but are actually able to improve through
          a person’s belief, perseverance, and hard work. It’s relevant as
          everyone essentially uses it in their daily life, especially us
          attending Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          If I’m being honest here, nothing has really changed for me or
          surprised me as I was already aware and taught of a Fixed/Growth
          Mindset during highschool.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’m not too sure how I’ll integrate a growth mindset into my learning
          journey as I feel like I’m already doing it.
