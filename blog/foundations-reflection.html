        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          There hasn't really been anything new that I've learnt about myself
          due to the Human Skills Learning.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think they are to enhance a programers ability to communicate with
          others and to also improve other skills.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The only thing that has surprised me about the Human Skills Learning
          is how important it is as Full Stack developer.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of the Human Skills Learning for me was
          the "Identity, Values, and Strengths" work as I didn't have much
          experience relating to the questions that we had to fill in and also
          because I'm not that comfortable writing/posting about that stuff.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The reason why Dev Academy values focusing on Human Skills learning is
          because they've asked companies before; what makes their students
          better than other programers, and they replied back that their
          students had better human skills. Besides that I think it's also to
          set up the students mental state so that they can learn/focus more in
          a friendly and supportive enviroment.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          For me only some of it felt like a minor waste of time as I've been
          taught a majority of the material during my time in highschool and
          would of much prefered to practice programming instead but I do
          understand that other people in the course may of not had the same
          oppurtunity as me. One thing I did find to be decent was the listening
          and looping exercise as I know that helps improve our skills to
          process and relay information better.
