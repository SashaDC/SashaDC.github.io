        <h1>Learning Plan.</h1>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I've wanted to be a software developer for a while so my long term
          goal is to improve my knowledge and skills so that I can become a
          successful developer and to continue to grow in the industry.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I'd say my strengths when it comes to learning is that I'm able to
          pick up things pretty fast, I'm pretty determined when I need to
          complete something, and know when to ask for help when I'm struggling.
          But my limitations/weakness that I know is that I am a bit of a
          procrastinator and get distracted easily meaning if I unfocus for more
          than 30 minutes I most likely wont return to learning with the right
          mindset until 2 hours later. Another limitation which is sort of a
          hinderence is that I find that coding/learning at ungodly hours are
          easier for me but a bit troublesome as most people wont be able to
          help me with my problems until they wake up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          While attending Dev Academy I'd like to build my confidence,
          communication, and creativity/imaginative skills up as I lack in those
          departments which could stunt my growth as a developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:
        </h3>
        <ul class="center">
          <li>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </li>
          <li>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          For my commitment to the workload I will try to always keep on top of
          my workload by being up and online at 8am, take 15 minute breaks away
          from my pc when I'm stuck on a problem to problem solve, prioritise
          the course work over distractions/keep distractions at bay, and ask
          for support when I need it. In order to work productively/safely with
          others is by maintaining respectful/professional bounderies and
          relationship with the facilitators/learners. If things start building
          up and getting to me I will let the facilitators and my work know so
          that I can try sort something out(if possible).
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will ask other learners and the facilitators for help in the discord
          channel or private messages in a timely way during the week in their
          active hours before things are too late.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
        <p>
          I'd expect the Facilitation team to help guide me when I'm stuck, Not
          by giving me the solution but by helping me understand the
          problem/area I'm having difficulties better.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I'm working part time so my block-out times would include: Monday to
          Wednesday 3pm to 10:30pm. Sometimes I will be asked if I can work
          extra shifts but I will make sure I'm able to complete course work
          first, besides that I don't currently have any other commitments.
