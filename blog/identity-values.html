        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths.</h1>
        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p>
          To be honest, I haven't really had a situation where I've made an
          ethical decision and had to weigh the options as I'm still pretty
          young and haven't had that many experiences yet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Well I'm Pakeha and grew up in Whangarei. I was raised in a somewhat
          big disfunctional family with my parents being seperated before I
          could even remember. By the time I was halfway through intermediate
          school I became self reliant and a bit closed off as I was starting to
          be neglected by both of my parents. Around high school I managed to
          get a good friend group which influenced me to value companionship,
          honesty and integrity which I try to uphold even now.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p id="ignore-the-space">
          Throughout my life I've constantly used these strengths:
        </p>
        <ul class="center" id="ignore-the-space">
          <li>Adaptability: Able to adapt to my surrounding enviroment.</li>
          <li>
            Analyitical/Critical Problem-solving: Able to find/figure out
            solutions to my problems. with
          </li>
          <li>
            Honesty and Integrity: Able to take accountability and admit to
            false claims
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These strengths will help support me as I continue to learn software
          developement and focus on my course work throughout this year.
          <!-- I felt the skills I listed speak for themselves on how they'll help me -->

        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The limitations that I was aware of during my learning developement
          were forgetfulness, procrastination and I did an 'Academic Strengths
          and Weaknesses: Q&A' which pointed out that I may have neuroticism
          which basically is overthinking and worrying. The ways these could
          affect my journey is by clouding my mind with doubt and make it harder
          to focus but I will try and overcome this issue over the year.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The only time I can think about is at work. When I became a supervisor
          in the department I work in and there were the 2 coworkers who were
          decent people but slacked off quite a bit which made it harder on me
          with my workload. I brought it up with them and tried figuring out
          ways to make them focus such as separating them while working or for
          me to work alongside the one who seemed to be slacking off a bit more
          so that I can nudge them back on track which they agreed to,
          regardless even after a few weeks went by they continued to ignore the
          plan leading to an entire department meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          My reflection on the whole situation was at the time I felt like I was
          a bit too lenient since I had only just become a supervisor and could
          of enforced things a bit better. There wasn't really a strategy I
          could of tried at the time as the only person they listened to was our
          manager, and even mentioning things to the manager at the time nothing
          really changed.
