        <h1>Javascript Dom.</h1>
        <h3>Describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
        <p>
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all things used for a website and have
          different purposes. HTML holds the content for the page, CSS stylizes
          the layout/design but what does JavaScript do? JavaScript uses logic
          to allow us to interact with and manipulate both HTML and CSS which
          allows us to do funky this like below.
        </p>
        <p id="JS-example">An example of JavaScript!</p>
        <button type="button" id="JSB-example">Click Me</button>
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/examplejs.png"
          alt="Example Of The JS Above"
          class="css-examples"
        />
        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Control Flow is the order in which JavaScript code is executed and
          allows us to control the direction of program. Loops is also a type of
          control flow and allow us to repeat something a set amount of times
          until it completes the specified amount. My everyday example of this
          would be this: Whenever I'm playing a game and face a difficult boss I
          will always fight it till its defeated, but sometimes its a lot harder
          than normal so it slowly chips away at my sanity and when that happens
          it looks a little like this:
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/loops-example.png"
          alt="loop example"
          class="css-examples"
        />
        <p>
          Basically my sanity starts out at 100, then while my sanity is greater
          than 0 I will continueously loose sanity with my sanity--. If my
          sanity is above 50 or equal to I'm still confident otherwise if its
          less than 50 I struggle badly.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h3>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model and its the structure of a
          website that allows us to interact/modify with websites using
          JavaScript. An example of this would be a person; The skeleton is
          HTML, Muscles/Organs are Javascript, CSS is the clothes and your brain
          is DOM.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Arrays store data in consecutive locations and always starts at 0
          like: array = [0, 1, 2, 3] <br />
          Where as objects are stored in named key values like: person = {name:
          'Sasha', age: '20', something else: true}. <br /><br />
          Arrays are better for lists and objects are better for detailed
          labeled information.
        </p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Format/make this look nicer -->
          Functions is a block of code containing a set of statements and loops
          to preform tasks. They are helpful as they allow us call them and
          reuse them without the need to repeat everything inside of them.
